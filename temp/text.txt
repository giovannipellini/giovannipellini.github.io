Wolfenstein 3D Engine
This is my reinterpretation of the Wolfenstein 3D Engine. It doesn't use any 3D technology, everything is done by the CPU. The player has a position and a field of view and the algorithm determines which blocks are inside, then it calculates the screen projection of its vertexes to draw the lines.

Technology
C# 2019 (Framework 4.7)

Wordle Solver
The porpouse of this Windows application is to solve the game Wordle. Given the list of english words it search for the most frequent letters used in every position. Then will search the nearest valid word in the dictionary. After guessing the algorithm will read the game hints and filter out any word that is not matching. The process then repeats until the word is found or the player is out of guesses.

 

It can play against wordlegame.org or against himself.
